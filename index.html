              <strong>Description:</strong> During my undergraduate studies at
              Amirkabir University, I worked on several academic projects,
              gaining experience with various technologies and services. The
              most significant courses were Web Programming and Cloud Computing:
              In the Web Programming course, we worked with Golang and completed
              three projects, the most notable being a Telegram-like
              application, where I also gained experience in frontend
              development using React. In the Cloud Computing course, we worked
              with services such as RabbitMQ, Elasticsearch, OpenStack, Docker,
              Kubernetes, and more. We completed multiple projects, gaining
              valuable experience with these technologies. Deployment was done
              using Docker, Docker Compose, Kubernetes, and platforms like
              Hamravesh and Docker Compose.
